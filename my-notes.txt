Current Features:
- Storage nodes can join controller
- Controller can check which nodes are alive
- Storage nodes can send heartbeats
- Storage nodes are able to rejoin if they time out
- Client can request info about remaining space and node requests completed
- Client can request info about which files are stored in node
- Client can store, retrieve and delete files
- Contoller can request new copies of chunks on a dead node
- Storage nodes can request new copies of corrupted chunks

ilovecats.txt :	chunk01 : {node03, node02, node01}
                          chunk02 : {node02, node03, node04}
                          chunk03 : {node01, node03, node04}

CASES THAT INVOLVE FAULT TOLERANCE
1) node01 declared as dead...need to find all the chunks that are stored in node01 and delete
2) checking replication level...need to check
      a) number of nodes < replication level, if so
      b) need to check that status is completed, if not
      c) need to check that hasvnt been in pending since timeout (to combat against reps that never made it)
3) file is corrupted, node requests a replica from controller who gives it a buddy to get it from

Limitations and Issues:
- Not reading to the closest newline, just going to the next newline character
- Key, value pairs are string, maybe better to have them as bytes?
- Should use serialization for the temp files
- Not verifiying a checksum of the sent so file
- No error handling when requesting job for not fully stored file
- Sending pair files over channel is bad bc then it reaaally limits us to one job at a time

Comments:
- Making it content aware with current implementation because i relied on the
  offset in the file name. Which made this a very challenging problem if i 
  wanted to treat data as a stream and not read it in twice.

Test commands:
~/go/bin/client orion05:24000 put ilovecats.txt 0.00004
~/go/bin/yarm orion05:24000 word_count/word_count.so ilovecats.txt
go build -buildmode=plugin word_count.go

Questions:
- Is letting manager know when all map jobs are complete on a single node?
  Or should we be doing it affter each line?
- Are we supposed to be sorting during the shuffle phase?
- I am waiting until map phase is done...is this bad?
- Wait, we don't need to close the conns right?
- Can only run one job at a time...

Create other temp files and append to those
So we get the four file from the context stuff
Sort them and send them over
Okay to let the reducer know hey im a reducer and there are 4 mappers
